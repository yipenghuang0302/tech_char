# The design library is used by design compiler to performance logic
# optimations.  Technology libraries contain information about the
# characteristics and functions of each cell provided in a semiconductor
# vendors library. Semiconductor vendors maintain and distribute
# the technology libraries. In our case the vendor is Synopsys. Cell
# characteristics include information such as cell names, pin names,
# area, delay arcs, and pin loading. The technology library also defines
# the conditions that must be met for a functional design (for example,
# the maximum transition time for nets).  These conditions are called
# design rule constraints. In addition to cell information and design rule
# constraints, technology libraries specify the operating conditions and
# wire load models specific to that technology.

# it includes detailed information about the poly and metal layers
# in the  design and the standard cell layouts.  These libraries also
# contain logical information (functionality and timing characteristics)
# for every cell in the library.  Finally, libraries contain technology
# information required for design and fabrication.  

# In a Milkyway library below you will find different views for each
# cell, for example, NOR1.CEL and NOR1.FRAM. CEL is the full layout view,
# and FRAM is the abstract view for place and route operation
